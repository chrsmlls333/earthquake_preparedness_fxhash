// ===================================

When the weight of an unattainable city skyline is pressed upon a person, it becomes a wall.

This project was the beginning of my experimentation with digital painting and orthographic '2.5D' layout. I had been doing moiré line studies for a year or two by this point, but a meme of Windows XP's famous window painting glitch, some exploration of hand-drawing in this early-gaming isometric layout, and an ongoing penchant to collect floorplans from architecture blogs on Tumblr led to this tonal study. Likely made after a revelatory WALLPAPERS exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery, giving lift to my mind toward the feasibility of a digital art practice.

Earthquake Preparedness was previously exhibited at 'untitled' art space and the City Hall Skytrain Station in Vancouver in 2016.

// Guide // ==========================

It's wallpaper, or a screensaver, no qualms about it. Some iterations of this work are quite slow, but please allow the cityscape to evolve. Meant to be displayed in landscape 16:9, and fullscreen. Scales to high DPI displays.

There's a very rare "Zoning: Undeveloped" feature which looks like a bug, but it's not :D

Tested on Chrome 116, Firefox 117.
